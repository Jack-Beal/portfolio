                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3 projects-highlight">Valentines Project</h3>
                    <p>This is a creative IoT-based Valentine's Day project that brings romantic LED light displays to
                        life through wireless communication. Jack's system uses a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with
                        12 addressable NeoPixel LEDs to create an interactive, networked light show that can be
                        triggered locally via a button press or remotely through MQTT messaging.</p>

                    <p>The project centers around a theme of connection and mutual moments—when Jack presses a physical
                        button on his device, it triggers one of seven beautiful light patterns (including "heartbeat,"
                        "pulse," "sparkle," "rainbow," "love_wave," "rose_garden," and "romance_album"). Simultaneously,
                        the system broadcasts this moment to a partner via MQTT over the internet using HiveMQ
                        Cloud as the broker. The truly special feature is the "mutual moment" detection: if both Jack
                        and other press their buttons within 2 seconds of each other, both devices light up with a
                        synchronized pattern, creating a magical shared experience despite physical distance. This
                        project elegantly demonstrates how IoT technology can be used to bridge gaps, making it a
                        particularly fitting use of embedded systems for expressing connection and affection during
                        Valentine's Day.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3 projects-highlight">Project Nova</h3>
                    <p>This is an engaging turn-based strategy game where two players compete to locate and capture
                        various sea creatures hidden on a 16x16 grid. Drawing inspiration from classic battleship-style
                        games, players take turns guessing coordinates to find creatures before their opponent does. The
                        game features four different creature types—Rays (V-shaped, 5 cells), Anemones (circular, 8
                        cells), Fish (linear, 3 cells), and Crabs (single cell)—each randomly placed and oriented on the
                        hidden grid at the start of the game. Players earn 5 points for each successful hit and must
                        reach 100 points to win, creating a competitive dynamic where both players are racing to
                        discover all the creatures first.</p>

                    <p>The game incorporates full save and load functionality, allowing players to pause their matches
                        at any point and resume later without losing progress. A pause menu appears every four turns,
                        giving players the option to save their game, continue playing, or exit gracefully. The
                        interface provides clear feedback on each guess (hits, misses, and duplicate guesses), and at
                        the end of the game, comprehensive statistics are displayed showing both players' final scores,
                        health, number of guesses, and their complete grids. With its intuitive coordinate-based
                        guessing system, creature variety, and strategic gameplay, this project demonstrates solid
                        object-oriented design principles through the Player class and effective file I/O handling for
                        game persistence.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3 projects-highlight">Memory Game</h3>
                    <p>This is a digital adaptation of the classic Simon Says memory game, built on a Raspberry Pi Pico
                        microcontroller with four colored LED buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow). The game
                        challenges players to memorize and replicate an increasingly complex sequence of LED flashes and
                        button presses. Each round, the game randomly adds a new color to the sequence and displays it
                        by flashing the corresponding LEDs. Players must then press the buttons in the exact order
                        shown; if they press the wrong button or press a button out of sequence, all four LEDs flash and
                        the game immediately ends. The game features adjustable difficulty levels—players can select
                        their preferred speed at startup (slow, normal, fast, or really fast) by pressing the
                        corresponding colored button, which affects how quickly the LED sequence is displayed.</p>

                    <p>The project seamlessly integrates IoT functionality through MQTT connectivity to HiveMQ Cloud,
                        allowing the game state (win or lose) to be published and shared across a network in real-time.
                        This networked feature enables the game results to be monitored remotely or used to trigger
                        actions on other connected devices. The use of a custom Components class encapsulates each
                        button-LED pair, making the code modular and scalable. With its intuitive button-based
                        interface, progressive difficulty, and networked capabilities, this memory game demonstrates
                        both embedded systems programming and cloud connectivity, making it an engaging way to test
                        cognitive skills while showcasing IoT integration on microcontroller platforms.</p>
